Overview
--------
   These notes describe the difference between OpenJPA release 1.1.0 and the
   preceding releases, 0.9.6, 0.9.7, and 1.0.0. 

   OpenJPA is a feature-rich implementation of the persistence part of Java
   Community Process JSR-220 (Enterprise JavaBeans 3.0), which is known as
   the Java Persistence API (JPA). OpenJPA can be used as a stand-alone POJO
   persistence layer, or it can be integrated into any EJB3.0 compliant
   container and many lightweight frameworks. This release of OpenJPA is 100%
   compliant with the JPA specification.

   Additional information on the OpenJPA project may be found at the project
   web site: http://openjpa.apache.org
