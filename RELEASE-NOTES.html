<h2><a name="Overview"></a>Overview</h2>

<p> These notes describe the difference between OpenJPA release 1.2.3
and the preceding release: 1.2.2.
<P>
OpenJPA is a feature-rich implementation of the persistence part of 
Java Community Process JSR-220 (Enterprise JavaBeans 3.0), which is
known as the Java Persistence API (JPA).
OpenJPA can be used as a stand-alone POJO persistence layer, or it can be
integrated into any EJB3.0 compliant container and many lightweight frameworks.
This release of OpenJPA is 100% compliant with the JPA specification.
