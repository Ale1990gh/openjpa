2007-08 Status Report for the Apache OpenJPA Project

Highlights

OpenJPA continues to work toward its first release as a TLP, to be called
OpenJPA 1.0.0. A few release candidates have been built and the release
is imminent.

There are no board issues at the moment.

Community

A public face-to-face meeting was held August 6 and 7, hosted by
BEA in San Jose. The meeting was advertised on the Apache party alias
in addition to the openjpa dev alias. The gathering was well-
attended, with 12 OpenJPA folks physically together, another
4 dialing in via conference call, and one invited outside speaker.
The results of the meeting were posted to the OpenJPA wiki at
http://openjpa.apache.org/openjpa-up-close-and-personal.html
Many discussion topics resulted in action items to be taken to the
dev and user aliases for community consensus.

Governance

The PMC has voted to grant commit privileges to Catalina Wei (fancy@a.o).
The PMC continues to track contributors with an eye toward making them
committers.

Releases

OpenJPA 1.0.0 is being prepared for release.
