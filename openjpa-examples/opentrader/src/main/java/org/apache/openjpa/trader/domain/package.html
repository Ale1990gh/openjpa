Persistent Domain Model for OpenTrader.

The domain model is designed to be a operable in the client-side Java runtime environment (JRE) provided by 
Google Web Toolkit (GWT). Because <A HREF="http://www.gwtapps.com/doc/html/jre.html">JRE Emulation Library GWT</A>
allows a subset of standard Java library classes, these domain classes are defined to use only that subset so that 
they can be translated by GWT Compiler.
