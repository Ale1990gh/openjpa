	access annotation. PROPERTY access is not permitted on fields
access-field-on-prop: Class "{0}" annotated method(s) "{1}" with FIELD access \
	annotation. FIELD access is not permitted on methods
access-mixed: Class "{0}" annotated fields "{1}" with FIELD access and \
	methods "{2}" with PROPERTY access. As class "{0}" is not using an explicit \
	access, it is not permitted to mix PROPERTY and FIELD access annotations

	no field or method is annotated either. It is not possible to determine \
	its access type
field-missing: "{0}" is not a managed field in "{1}"
field-not-decl: "{0}" is not declared in "{1}" itself but one of its \
	persistent super class
field-type-mismatch: Actual type of field "{0}" "{1}" does not match with the \
	expected type "{2}"
field-element-type-mismatch: Actual element type of field "{0}" "{1}" does not \
	match with the expected element type "{2}"

mmg-bad-naming: Naming policy for meta-model classes specified in -Anaming \
	option "{0}" can not be used due to "{1}". Using default naming policy.
