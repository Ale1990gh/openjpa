Overview

   These notes describe the difference between OpenJPA release 2.0.0 Milestone
   1 and the preceding release, 1.2.0. 

   OpenJPA is a feature-rich implementation of the persistence part of Java
   Community Process JSR-220 (Enterprise JavaBeans 3.0), which is known as
   the Java Persistence API (JPA). OpenJPA can be used as a stand-alone POJO
   persistence layer, or it can be integrated into any EJB3.0 compliant
   container and many lightweight frameworks. This release of OpenJPA is 100%
   compliant with the JPA specification.

   This release of OpenJPA also includes some functionality from the Java 
   Community Process JSR-317 (JPA 2.0). For the complete list of supported 
   features please refer to the OpenJPA online issue tracker: 
   http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/OPENJPA.
