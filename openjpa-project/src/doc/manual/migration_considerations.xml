    		OpenJPA 1.x.x releases and the 2.0 release. Some of these may

    					The OpenJPAEntityManagerFactory interface getProperties()
    					method was changed to return a Map instead of a
    					Properties object. This change was made in order to
    					support the getProperties() method defined in the 2.0
    					JPA specification.

    				Detach Behavior
    			</title>
    			<para>
    			The detach behavior has changed in several ways:
					<itemizedlist>
						<listitem>
							<para>
							In the 1.x.x release, managed entities
							were flushed to the database as part of the
							detach operation. This is no longer done in
							2.0.
							</para>
						</listitem>
						<listitem>
							<para>
							In the 1.x.x release, entities were copied
							and returned. In 2.0, for those methods
							that have return values, the original
							entities are returned.
							</para>
						</listitem>
						<listitem>
							<para>
							In the 1.x.x release, managed entities still
							exist in the persistent context. In 2.0,
							they are removed.
							</para>
						</listitem>
						<listitem>
							<para>
							In the 1.x.x release, the detach operation
							is recursively cascaded to all referenced
							entities. In 2.0, the detach operation is
							only cascade to those entities for which
							Cascade=detach has been specified.
							</para>
						</listitem>
					</itemizedlist>
    			</para>
    			<para>
    				It is possible to revert back to the 1.x.x behavior for
    				some of these items by setting the openjpa.Compatibility
    				property as follows:
    				<simplelist>
    					<member>CopyOnDetach=true</member>
    					<member>FlushBeforeDetach=true</member>
    					<member>CascadeWithDetach=true</member>
    				</simplelist>
    			</para>
    			<para>
    				In addition, a new method has been provided on the
    				<ulink url="../javadoc/org/apache/openjpa/persistence/OpenJPAEntityManager.html">
					<classname>OpenJPAEntityManager</classname></ulink>
    				interface to return a copy of the entity:
    				<programlisting>
					public &lt;T&gt; T detachCopy(T pc):
					</programlisting>
