    		The following list indicates changes that are incompatible between
    		OpenJPA 1.x.x releases and the 2.0 release. Some of these may
    		require application changes.

    					<para>
    					The OpenJPAEntityManagerFactory interface getProperties()
    					method was changed to return a Map instead of a
    					Properties object. This change was made in order to
    					support the getProperties() method defined in the 2.0
    					JPA specification.
