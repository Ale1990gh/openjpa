                The following sections indicate changes that are incompatible between
    		OpenJPA 1.3 and prior releases. Some may
    		require application changes. Others can be remedied through the use
                of compatibility options.

            <para>
                    The Query interface setParameters() method behavior has
                    changed to throw an ArgumentException if more
                    parameter substitutions are supplied than defined in the
                    createQuery() or createNamedQuery() call, as required by
                    the JPA2 specification.
                    OpenJPA 1.2.x and prior versions would silently ignore the
                    supplied parameter substitutions and allow the Query to be
                    processed.

                Serialization of Entities

            <para>
                    In prior releases of OpenJPA, when an entity was serialized
                    after calling EntityManager.find(), detach() or detachAll()
                    then all <xref linkend="ref_guide_pc_scos_proxy"/>
                    were removed as expected, but when the same entity instance
                    was serialized after calling EntityManager.clear() the
                    proxy classes were not removed.
            </para>
            <para>
                    Starting with OpenJPA 1.3, this behavior has been
                    modified, so that by default all proxies will be removed
                    during serialization.  See
                    <xref linkend="ref_guide_detach_state"/>
                    on how the behavior changes based on the
                    <literal>DetachedStateField</literal> setting along with
                    how to override the default behavior.

            <para>
                If an entity was updated between the persist()
                and commit() operations in OpenJPA 1.x, then
                any PreUpdate and PostUpdate life cycle callback
                methods would be executed.  Starting in OpenJPA
                1.3 and 2.0, these callbacks will not get executed.
            </para>
            <para>
                The JPA 2.0 specification section on "Semantics
                of the Life Cycle Callback Methods for Entities"
                has been updated to include a Note that the
                callback behavior for updating an entity after
                the persist operation is implementation specific
                and should not be relied upon.
