        <para>
                The following sections indicate changes that are incompatible between
    		OpenJPA 1.3 and prior releases. Some may
    		require application changes. Others can be remedied through the use
                of compatibility options.

            <para>
                    The Query interface setParameters() method behavior has
                    changed to throw an ArgumentException if more
                    parameter substitutions are supplied than defined in the
                    createQuery() call, as required by the JPA2 specification.
                    OpenJPA 1.2.x and prior versions would silently ignore the
                    supplied parameter substitutions and allow the Query to be
                    processed.
            </para>

                    See OPENJPA-1213 for test cases that
                    demonstrate the behavioral differences.
