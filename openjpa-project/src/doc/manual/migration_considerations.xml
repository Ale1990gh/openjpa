        <para>
                The following sections indicate changes that are incompatible between
    		OpenJPA 1.3 and prior releases. Some may
    		require application changes. Others can be remedied through the use
                of compatibility options.

            <para>
                    The Query interface setParameters() method behavior has
                    changed to throw an ArgumentException if more
                    parameter substitutions are supplied than defined in the
                    createQuery() or createNamedQuery() call, as required by
                    the JPA2 specification.
                    OpenJPA 1.2.x and prior versions would silently ignore the
                    supplied parameter substitutions and allow the Query to be
                    processed.

                    See OPENJPA-1213 for test cases that
                    demonstrate the behavioral differences.

            </title>
            <para>
                If an entity was updated between the persist()
                and commit() operations in OpenJPA 1.x, then
                any PreUpdate and PostUpdate life cycle callback
                methods would be executed.  Starting in OpenJPA
                1.3 and 2.0, these callbacks will not get executed.
            </para>
            <para>
                The JPA 2.0 specification section on "Semantics
                of the Life Cycle Callback Methods for Entities"
                has been updated to include a Note that the
                callback behavior for updating an entity after
                the persist operation is implementation specific
                and should not be relied upon.

            <para>
                See OPENJPA-1182 for an
                example test case demonstrating the change.
