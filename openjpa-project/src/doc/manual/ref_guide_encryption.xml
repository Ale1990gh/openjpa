        Encryption Provider
    </title>
    <para>
	OpenJPA provides an interface for a provider to implement to allow 
	connection passwords to be encrypted. Whenever a connection password 
	is needed, the decrypt(String) method will be invoked. See 
	<ulink url="../javadoc/org/apache/openjpa/lib/encryption/EncryptionProvider.html">
	<classname>org.apache.openjpa.lib.encryption.EncryptionProvider</classname>
	</ulink> for the detailed javadoc.

                It is an OpenJPA users responsibility to implement the EncryptionProvider
                interface. There is not a default implementation.

            <para>
                The interface has an encrypt(String) method, but it is not called by the OpenJPA runtime.
