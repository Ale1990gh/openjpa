Implements TransactionManager to manage transactions across the database
slices. This package provides two flavors of TransactionManager: one provides
two-phase commit protocol when all underlying database slices is XA-complaint;
while the other runs commit/rollback simply looping across all database slices
when one or more underlying database slices is not XA-complaint and hence does 
not guarantee atomic nature of transaction.
